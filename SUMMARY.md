## Technical Details

### New AI Prompt Structure
```python
prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant helping students with their campus grievances.

**Grievance:**
Title: {title}
Description: {description}

**Relevant Knowledge Base Information:**
1. Document Name: Excerpt...
2. Document Name: Excerpt...

Provide a brief, actionable suggestion (30-40 words max) for the student.
Focus on:
1. Immediate steps they can take
2. Relevant resources from the knowledge base
3. Expected timeline or next steps

Keep it concise, friendly, and solution-focused."""
```

### Markdown Rendering
```tsx
<ReactMarkdown
  components={{
    p: ({ children }) => <p className="text-sm text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-2 last:mb-0">{children}</p>,
    strong: ({ children }) => <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">{children}</strong>,
    ul: ({ children }) => <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm space-y-1 my-2">{children}</ul>,
    // ... more custom components
  }}
>
  {previewData.ai_summary}
</ReactMarkdown>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Submit a grievance with preview mode
- [ ] Verify AI suggestion is 30-40 words
- [ ] Check markdown formatting renders correctly
- [ ] Confirm documents section is removed
- [ ] Test in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Verify KB chunks are being used in AI prompt
- [ ] Check fallback message when OpenAI unavailable
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Students get actionable advice quickly
2. **Cleaner UI**: Removed unnecessary documents section
3. **Professional**: Markdown formatting looks polished
4. **Contextual**: KB chunks inform AI suggestions
5. **Consistent**: Custom styling matches design system
6. **Accessible**: Dark mode support, proper semantics
7. **Efficient**: Short suggestions save reading time

## Documentation Added

1. **`AI_SUGGESTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - Detailed change log
2. **`MARKDOWN_STYLING_GUIDE.md`** - React Markdown reference
3. **`SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add loading skeleton while AI generates suggestion
2. Allow students to rate AI suggestions (helpful/not helpful)
3. Cache AI suggestions to reduce API calls
4. Add suggestion refresh button
5. Implement A/B testing for prompt variations
6. Add analytics to track suggestion effectiveness

## API Response Structure

```json
{
  "preview": true,
  "grievance": {...},
  "ai_generated_tags": ["library", "ac_issue"],
  "kb_suggestions": [

}
```

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure OpenAI API key is configured in backend
2. Verify MongoDB has KB chunks indexed
3. Check `react-markdown` package is installed in frontend
