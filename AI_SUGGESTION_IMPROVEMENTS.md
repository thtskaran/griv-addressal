# AI Suggestion Improvements - Student-Focused Experience

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Documents Section from Preview**
- Removed the "Uploaded Documents" section from the grievance preview page
- Students now see only AI suggestions and relevant KB documents
- Cleaner, more focused preview experience

### 2. **Enhanced AI Prompt for Students**
Created a new method `generate_student_suggestion()` that:
- Generates **30-40 word** concise suggestions
- Focuses on actionable steps for students
- Uses KB chunks as context for relevant recommendations
- Returns markdown-formatted responses

**Old Prompt (Admin-focused):**
```
Summarize the following grievances with trends and suggested actions
```
❌ Long, administrative summary
❌ Generic JSON dump
❌ Not student-friendly

**New Prompt (Student-focused):**
```
You are a helpful assistant helping students with their campus grievances.

Provide a brief, actionable suggestion (30-40 words max) for the student.
Focus on:
1. Immediate steps they can take
2. Relevant resources from the knowledge base
3. Expected timeline or next steps

Keep it concise, friendly, and solution-focused.
```
✅ Short, 30-40 words
✅ Uses KB context
✅ Actionable and student-friendly
✅ Markdown formatted

### 3. **Added React Markdown Support**
- Installed `react-markdown` package
- AI suggestions now render with proper markdown formatting
- Supports:
  - **Bold** and *italic* text
  - Bullet and numbered lists
  - Proper paragraph spacing
  - Custom styling for dark/light themes

### 4. **Updated Backend Flow**

**Before:**
```python
def generate_ai_suggestions(grievance, related_grievances):
    summary = facade.summarize_grievances([grievance])  # Long admin summary
    return {"summary": summary, ...}
```

**After:**
```python
def generate_ai_suggestions(grievance, related_grievances, kb_chunks):
    student_suggestion = facade.generate_student_suggestion(
        grievance, 
        kb_chunks  # Pass KB context to AI
    )
    return {"summary": student_suggestion, ...}
```

### 5. **Improved UI/UX**

**AI Suggestion Card:**
- Changed title from "AI Analysis" → "AI Suggestion"
- Markdown rendering with custom styles
- Better visual hierarchy with prose classes
- Consistent spacing and typography

**Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AI Suggestion                       │
│  ├─ Bot icon                         │
│  └─ Short, markdown-formatted text   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Relevant KB Documents (collapsible) │
│  ├─ Document 1 (85% match)           │
│  ├─ Document 2 (72% match)           │
│  └─ Document 3 (68% match)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Code Changes

### Backend (`be/utils.py`)

#### New Method: `generate_student_suggestion()`
```python
def generate_student_suggestion(self, grievance: Dict[str, Any], kb_chunks: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    """
    Generate a short, actionable suggestion for students (30-40 words) using KB context.
    """
    # Build context from KB chunks
    kb_context = ""
    if kb_chunks:
        kb_context = "\n\n**Relevant Knowledge Base Information:**\n"
        for i, chunk in enumerate(kb_chunks[:3], 1):
            doc_name = chunk.get("doc_name", "Document")
            excerpt = chunk.get("excerpt", "")[:200]
            kb_context += f"{i}. {doc_name}: {excerpt}\n"
    
    prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant helping students...
    
    Provide a brief, actionable suggestion (30-40 words max)...
    """
    
    completion = self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model=self.chat_model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        max_tokens=100,  # Limit response length
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content.strip()
```

#### Updated: `generate_ai_suggestions()`
```python
def generate_ai_suggestions(
    grievance: Dict[str, Any],
    related_grievances: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
    kb_chunks: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,  # NEW: KB chunks parameter
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    facade = OpenAIClientFacade()
    student_suggestion = facade.generate_student_suggestion(grievance, kb_chunks or [])
    # ... rest of the function
```

### Backend (`be/app.py`)

```python
# Pass KB chunks to AI suggestion generator
ai_suggestions = generate_ai_suggestions(temp_grievance, [], kb_chunks)
```

### Frontend (`fe/client/src/pages/user/GrievancePreview.tsx`)

#### Added Import:
```tsx
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';
```

#### Updated AI Suggestion Display:
```tsx
<ReactMarkdown
  components={{
    p: ({ children }) => <p className="text-sm text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-2 last:mb-0">{children}</p>,
    strong: ({ children }) => <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">{children}</strong>,
    ul: ({ children }) => <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm space-y-1 my-2">{children}</ul>,
    ol: ({ children }) => <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-sm space-y-1 my-2">{children}</ol>,
    li: ({ children }) => <li className="text-foreground">{children}</li>,
  }}
>
  {previewData.ai_summary}
</ReactMarkdown>
```

#### Removed:
```tsx
{/* Uploaded Documents section - REMOVED */}
```

## Example Output

### Before:
```
AI Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This grievance appears to be related to infrastructure 
maintenance issues in the library facility. The student 
has reported that the air conditioning system has been 
non-functional for approximately one week in the reading 
hall area. Based on the historical data and trending 
analysis, this falls under the LIBRARY department 
category with tags related to HVAC systems and facility 
maintenance. The administrative team should prioritize 
this issue as it affects student comfort and study 
environment. Recommended action: Dispatch facilities 
maintenance team for immediate assessment and repair...
(continues for 200+ words)
```

### After:
```
AI Suggestion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Submit a maintenance request to the Library department 
immediately. According to the **Facilities Guide**, AC 
repairs typically take 2-3 business days. Meanwhile, 
consider using the computer lab on the 2nd floor.
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Concise** - 30-40 words vs 200+ words
2. ✅ **Actionable** - Clear next steps for students
3. ✅ **Contextual** - Uses KB chunks for relevant advice
4. ✅ **Professional** - Markdown formatting
5. ✅ **Student-focused** - Friendly, helpful tone
6. ✅ **Clean UI** - Removed unnecessary documents section
7. ✅ **Better UX** - Faster to read and understand

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Library AC Issue
**Input:**
- Title: "Library AC not working"
- Description: "The AC has been off for a week in the reading hall"

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
Contact the **Facilities Department** immediately. Per the 
maintenance policy, AC repairs are prioritized and should 
be completed within 2-3 business days. Use the computer 
lab on floor 2 as an alternative.
```

### Test Case 2: Hostel Food Quality
**Input:**
- Title: "Hostel mess food quality poor"
- Description: "The food served in the mess is not good"

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
File a formal complaint with the **Mess Committee**. 
According to the hostel handbook, they conduct quality 
reviews within 48 hours. You can also provide feedback 
through the monthly survey.
```

## Dependencies

- `react-markdown`: ^10.1.0
- OpenAI API with chat completions support
- MongoDB with KB chunks indexed

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. The API response structure remains the same, only the content of `ai_summary` has changed from long admin summaries to short student suggestions.
