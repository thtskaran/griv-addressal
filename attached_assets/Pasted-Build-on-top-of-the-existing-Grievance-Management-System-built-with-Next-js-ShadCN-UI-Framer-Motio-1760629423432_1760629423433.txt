Build on top of the existing Grievance Management System built with Next.js, ShadCN UI, Framer Motion, Recoil, and Manrope font.
Maintain the same color palette, responsiveness, and design consistency.

🔹 1. User “Grievance Preview” Page

After a grievance is submitted, redirect the user to a Preview Page.

This page should include:

Preview of the uploaded image (top section, large, centered, rounded corners).

Grievance title and description underneath.

Two large buttons at the bottom:

🟩 “Did you get help?” → shows a “Thank you, your grievance has been resolved” message.

🟦 “Still Submit” → confirms submission and redirects the user to their dashboard.

Animate transitions using Framer Motion (fade-in + upward slide).

🔹 2. Admin Analytics Page Enhancement

Enhance the existing analytics page that already shows a Pie Chart and Bar Graph.

When the admin clicks on a segment of the pie chart (e.g., “Hostel”, “Academics”, “Sports”), dynamically display that category’s detailed analytics below the charts.

Display these analytics in a knowledge-graph visualization using D3.js or React Force Graph.

Each node represents a grievance, and connections show relationships (like “common keywords” or “department links”).

Example: Clicking “Hostel” → shows all hostel-related grievances as an interactive knowledge graph.

🔹 3. Admin “Send Message” Feature

Add this functionality to the Admin Dashboard.

Each grievance card (or detail view) should have a “Send Message” button that opens a chat modal or drawer.

Inside the chat section:

A text input box for the admin to type a message.

Two buttons below:

Send → sends the message to that specific user (store message data locally or simulate API).

View Chat History → redirects the admin to a full-page chat history view for that specific conversation.

Chat History Page:

Full-width, clean page layout.

Shows complete message history between that user and admin.

Messages should appear as chat bubbles, aligned left/right based on sender.

Include a timestamp and auto-scroll to the latest message.

Maintain a soft, minimal UI (similar to ShadCN chat components).

🔹 4. Admin “Google Drive” Page

Add a new page called Google Drive under the Admin panel sidebar.

Two inputs:

Google Drive folder link

Email address (to grant read access)

One Submit button → clicking it redirects to a Drive Dashboard page.

Google Drive Dashboard:

Mimic the layout of Google Drive with file cards shown in a grid view.

Each card displays:

File icon (PDF, DOC, etc.)

File name

Last modified date.

Add a search bar at the top for filtering.

Clicking a file opens a modal showing a mock preview.

🔹 5. Add Two Static Informational Pages

Hostel Rules & Regulations Page

Simple static page with a title and descriptive rules (dummy content is fine).

Use elegant typography and card layout.

Accessible from both admin and user dashboards.

MAKAUT Exam Details Page

Display mock information about MAKAUT exam schedules, forms, or guidelines.

Use card components for each exam item.

🧩 Technical Notes:

Use ShadCN UI components (Card, Button, Input, etc.).

Maintain Manrope as the font family throughout.

Use Tailwind CSS for layout and responsiveness.

Add smooth page transitions using Framer Motion.

Keep pages modular with reusable components.

Make all routes connected using Next.js routing.
